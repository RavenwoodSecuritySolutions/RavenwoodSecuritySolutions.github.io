        <p class="left font-deluxe-light">
            Before you can claim protection under the Ravenwood Security Solutions Client Umbrella, you must agree to all sections of this agreement.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="roe">Section 1 - Rules Of Engagement</h2>
        <p class="left">
            By agreeing to this section of the Client Agreement, you agree to respect and follow the Member Rules Of Engagement, specified in our <a href="../member-agreement#roe">Member Agreement.</a>
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="eoc">Section 2 - Exclusivity Of Combat</h2>
        <p class="left">
            While bound under this section of the Client Agreement, you understand and accept that if you attack another Client of Ravenwood Security Solutions,
            we will retaliate as we are obligated to. You also understand that should you choose to attack another Client, you will be permanently removed as a Client of Ravenwood.<br>
            <br>
            This means your protection under the Client Umbrella will be null and void, and you will be removed as a Client in the Discord Server.<br>
            You will not be eligible for protection from Ravenwood Security Solutions and you will not be allowed within the RSS compound.
